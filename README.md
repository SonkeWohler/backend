# Trying out Docker Rest API

This is a proof of concept regarding running a Rest API with Python/Flask
inside Docker.

## Tutorials Used

* [Quick start for Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)
* [Putting Docker inside git repositories](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/dockerfile-git-strategies)
* [Flask inside Docker](https://pyshark.com/containerize-a-flask-application-using-docker/)
* [For testing API in browser](https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/blog/docker-expose-port/)

## Running

It should simply run as defined in `run_docker.sh`.  On Linux you can just run
the following:
```
source run_docker.sh
```

### Requirements

Aside from [docker](https://www.docker.com/) being installed and setup there
shouldn't be anything needed.
